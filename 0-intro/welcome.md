# Welcome to Maths & Physics for AI/ML

This course builds the mathematical, physical, and computational foundations required to learn machine learning effectively. It is hands-on: each topic includes concise lessons, targeted exercises, and worked solutions.

## Who this is for

- New or transitioning engineers who want a solid pre-ML foundation
- Practitioners who want to refresh fundamentals before advanced ML

## Outcomes

By the end, you should be comfortable with:

- Linear algebra operations, eigenvalues/eigenvectors, and SVD
- Probability basics, common distributions, Bayes, estimation (MLE/MAP)
- Calculus for optimization: gradients, chain rule, Jacobians
- Core optimization methods (e.g., gradient descent) and intuition
- Discrete math essentials for data structures and graphs
- Physics concepts that build intuition for signals, fields, and entropy
- CS foundations: algorithms/data structures, complexity, numerical methods

## How to use this repo

1. Read `setup-guide.md` to prepare your environment
2. Start with `1-mathematics/linear-algebra/lessons/`
3. Attempt the matching `exercises/` before peeking at `solutions/`
4. Keep notes and references in `reference-materials/`
5. Place your work under `submissions/<your-name>/<track>/...`

## Time commitment (suggested)

- 6–8 hours/week for 4–6 weeks (adjust to your pace)

## Support

If you get stuck, consult reference materials, search error messages, and discuss with peers. Focus on understanding ideas over memorizing formulas.
